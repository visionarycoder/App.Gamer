# Day 2

Today is the day!  The Product Owner has new requirements for you.  

"We have come up with a new game.  Connect 4!  Isn't this great.  We're going to make millions on this one.  HHow fast can you add into the existing game platform?!?  We want to go to market next week.  I hope that is OK.  I've already said you can get it done to the board.  This is going to be great!"

Queue a wild range of emotions on the development team aka you.
