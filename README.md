I joined the cult of Juval Lowy over a decade ago. (It's a metaphor.) This cult is the practiioners of Lowy's concept, Volatility-Based Decomposition.  I have been workign with this system for well over a decade.  I feel like I understand the principals and yet...  There is always more to learn.  

I find that I learn by charing my ideas.  Knowing I will need to be able to discuss a subject and prove meaningful answers to a great many questions shifts my perspecitve a bit and I push myself harder to fully emerce myself in the topic.  

## Background

I went to 3 5-Day on-site iDesign training classes: Architect's Master Class, Project Design Master class, and Service Fabric Master class.  The content from the Arch and Proj master classes provide the 2 sections to "Righting Software" by Juval Lowy.  

At University, I was a Teaching Assistant.  I learned that I enjoy teaching others new ideas and new approaches to problem solving.  I earned a BA in Anthropology with a Related Field in Computer Science.  Yeah.  I know.  Kind of weird.  Long story behind that one...

After I got my BA, I ended up working as a WebMaster building web sites and CD-ROMs.  I also enrolled in an MBA/MIS program.  I got within 2 classes of finish it before I left the midwest for a job in Oregon.  

## Recent History

Obviously, I have been doing my part to bring new people into the cult.  But...  It has been a struggle.  It occured to me last week, after walking a developer through the process of converting thier code into a pre-cursor state to easy the transistion into a more full-blown implementation.  He didn't get it.  He said he would do it, but I don't beleive he really understood the value in what I was trying to share.  

My tiny brain continued to crank away on this.  After a few days, a bit more sleep, and a lot of caffiene, I think I have a new idea to explain the "What do I get out of this?" question that developers always ask (even if it is unspoken) when I show VBD.  

## My Intent

With App.Gamer, I'm going to try another way to show how the basics of volatility-based decomposition can be implemented and most importantly why you should consider this approach.  In short, it helps make your life easier.  Not on Day 0.  Not on Day 1.  Maybe on Day 2.  Definitely every day after that.

It's time.  Get comfortable.  Let's take a look at Day 0.
